C++ Zoo Practice Assignment
Objective:
Develop your skills in C++ control structures, data structures (Array, Vector, Map), file I/O, and basic OOP design through a "C++ Zoo Practice" application. This project involves processing file information, managing animal data, and generating a report.

Background:
The zoo has received a new list of animals. Organize this information, process it, and prepare a report on the animals, including their specific enclosures.

Important:
This program is crucial for preparing for your major midterm project. Seek help if needed through tutors, joining our Discord server, forming a study group, or finding a lab partner.

Requirements:

Class Design:

Create an Animal class with properties like name (string), age (int), and species (string), including a constructor, getters, and setters.
Develop four subclasses: Hyena, Lion, Tiger, and Bear, each with unique attributes or methods.
Data Structures:

Use std::vector for storing animal instances and std::map for counting species.
File I/O:

Read animal details from arrivingAnimals.txt and output a report to newAnimals.txt, categorizing animals by species with names, ages, and total counts.
Control Structures & OOP Design:

Implement loops, conditionals, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in C++ as specified.
Tasks:

Implement the Animal class and its subclasses.
Process instances from the input file using C++ data structures.
Generate a report in the specified format.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your source code with comments explaining your logic.
Include a report on your design choices and implementation.
Reach out for help as needed to ensure you're prepared for the midterm project.
This assignment is designed to solidify your understanding of crucial C++ concepts through a practical application, setting a strong foundation for more complex projects ahead.
